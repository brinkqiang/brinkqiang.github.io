Integrity means not being afraid of strength, not being weak, being brave enough, being able to stick to the right path, and being brave enough to acknowledge mistakes. Integrity means having the courage to uphold your beliefs. This includes the ability to insist on what you think is right, to look back when needed, and to openly oppose what you believe is wrong.
